**This repository is the official repository of the AIGIBench.**

**This repository contains the AIGIBench dataset and the evaluated methods.**

 **AIGIBench** dataset contains two types of training and 25 test subsets. This dataset has the following advantages:
- Comprehensive generate types: including GAN-based Noise-to-Image Generation, Diffusion for Text-to-Image Generation, GANs for Deepfake, Diffusion for Personalized Generation, and Open-source Platforms.
- State-of-the-art Generators: MidjourneyV6, Stable Diffusion 3, Imagen, DALLE3, InstantID, FaceSwap, StyleGAN-XL and so on.
- Completely unknown generation method: Crawl pictures from communities and social media to build datasets CommunityAI & SocialRF, making detection more challenging.

## 📚Dataset
The training set and testing set used in the paper can be downloaded on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HorizonTEL/AIGIBench).

Each folder contains compressed files. After unzip the file, files under the data root directory can be organized as follows.
### Train
AIGIBench introduces two training dataset settings: **(i) Setting-I:** Training on 144K images generated by ProGAN across four object categories—car, cat, chair, and horse. **(ii) Setting-II:** Training on 144K images generated by both SD-v1.4 and ProGAN, covering the same four object categories. The data of ProGAN comes from ForenSynths, and the data of sdv1.4 comes from GenImage. In order to maintain the fairness of the training data, we randomly select the sdv1.4 training images of GenImage to keep the same number as ProGAN, and then merge the data. The file directory is as follows:

```
├── train
│   ├── car
│   │   ├── 0_real
│   │   ├── 1_fake
│   ├── cat
│   │   ├── ...

│   ├── horse

│   ├── sdv1.4

├── val
│   ├── ...
│   │   ├── 0_real
│   │   ├── 1_fake
│   │   ...
```

### Test
AIGIBench comprehensively tests the performance of the detector and builds a test dataset from five perspectives: GAN-based Noise-to-Image Generation, Diffusion for Text-to-Image Generation, GANs for Deepfake, Diffusion for Personalized Generation, and Open-source Platforms. The file directory is as follows:
```
├── test
│   ├── ProGAN
│   │   ├── 0_real
│   │   ├── 1_fake
│   ├── R3GAN
│   │   ├── ...

## 🔍Detection Methods
We use the official code for all detection codes and make unified modifications to the input and output. The code we use for training in Setting-II is publicly available above, the corresponding pre-trained checkpoints are publicly available on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/HorizonTEL/AIGIBench). Of course, if you need the code from the original paper, the following is the corresponding detection code in the paper：
